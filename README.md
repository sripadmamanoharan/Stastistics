# Stastistics


This repository contains a comprehensive statistics project that involves data analysis, statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and data visualization. The project demonstrates how to apply key statistical concepts to real-world datasets using Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy.

Project Overview
This project focuses on performing various statistical analyses, including descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, correlation analysis, and regression modeling. It serves as a guide for understanding fundamental statistical techniques used in data science and research.

Key Concepts Covered:
Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation).
Probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson).
Hypothesis testing (t-test, chi-square test, ANOVA).
Correlation and regression analysis.
Data visualization using histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and more.

Installation
To run this project, you will need to install Python and the following libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scipy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/statistics-project.git
cd statistics-project
Usage
You can run the statistical analysis scripts using Python. The analysis is divided into multiple stages, such as descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis. To perform the analysis on a dataset, simply run the scripts:

bash
Copy code
python descriptive_statistics.py --input_file data/dataset.csv
You can also perform hypothesis testing:

bash
Copy code
python hypothesis_testing.py --input_file data/dataset.csv --test ttest --alpha 0.05
Command Line Arguments:
--input_file: Path to the input dataset in CSV format.
--test: Specify the type of test (ttest, chi2, anova, etc.).
--alpha: Significance level for hypothesis testing (default: 0.05).
Example:
bash
Copy code
python regression_analysis.py --input_file data/house_prices.csv --dependent_variable price
Dataset
The project supports any dataset that fits the required analysis. The datasets used in the examples are as follows:

House Prices Dataset: Used for regression analysis.
Customer Behavior Dataset: Used for correlation analysis and hypothesis testing.
You can replace the dataset by placing your own CSV file in the data/ folder and specifying the path in the command line arguments.

Statistical Analyses
1. Descriptive Statistics
Description: Provides a summary of central tendency (mean, median, mode), variability (variance, standard deviation), and distribution shape (skewness, kurtosis).
Usage: Useful for getting a quick understanding of the dataset.
2. Probability Distributions
Description: Fits and visualizes various probability distributions such as normal, binomial, and Poisson distributions.
Use Case: Useful for analyzing the distribution of data and identifying patterns.
3. Hypothesis Testing
Description: Tests hypotheses about the dataset, such as whether the means of two samples are significantly different or whether two variables are independent.
Tests Implemented:
T-Test: For comparing two means.
Chi-Square Test: For testing relationships between categorical variables.
ANOVA: For comparing means across multiple groups.
4. Correlation and Regression Analysis
Correlation: Measures the strength of relationships between variables using Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients.
Linear Regression: Fits a linear model to predict a dependent variable from one or more independent variables.
Multiple Regression: Explores the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables.
Results
The results for each analysis are presented through statistical summaries and visualizations. For example:

Descriptive Statistics Output: Mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
Hypothesis Testing Results: P-values and whether the null hypothesis is rejected.
Correlation Matrix: A table showing correlation coefficients between variables.
Regression Analysis Results: Regression coefficients, R-squared values, and residual plots.
